          In the time of the micro computer software were written specifically for
          each computer, as they all came with their own operating system build
          into them. Burned into their microchips where the commands that they
          understood, and programmers needed to write their programs to the
          specific machine. The amount of software available for a specific
          computer played a significant role in it’s success.

          This is one of the reasons for the huge success of the Commodore 64.
          With it’s powerful graphics and sound processors it was a perfect
          platform for games and it gave programmers a strong platform to
          developed all sorts. Of the more famous ones one could mention: 
          <ul>
            <li>Archon: The Light and the Dark (1983) – A mythical battle chess</li>
            <li>Impossible Mission (1984) - A platform action game</li>
            <li>Pitstop II (1984) – A car race simulation</li>
            <li>Elite (1985) – A space simulation game</li>
            <li>Leaderboard Golf (1986) – A sport simulation</li>
            <li>IK+ (1987) – A fighting game</li>
            <li>InternationalSoccer (1988) – A soccer simulation</li>
            <li>Grand Prix Circuit (1989) – Formula One</li>
            <li>Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday (1990) – an adventure/RPG,</li>
            <li>Creatures 2: Torture Trouble (1992) – Platform type</li>
            <li>Mayhem in Monsterland (1993) – A platform type</li>

          A contester to the micro computer was IBM’s so-called Personal Computer
          or PC although is was much pricier and did not find it’s way into normal
          homes straight away. was a much began to change as the new IBM PC (PC
          for Personal Computer) entered the market. The IBM PC used a software
          operating system. This had to load on startup, but made it easier to
          update - simply because you did not need to buy a completely new piece
          of hardware. The OS (for Operating System) was called MSDOS, this was
          short for Micro-Soft Disk Operating System (yes, they used a dash in
          their name in the early days). The code was based on the UNIX operating
          system although greatly simplified.

          Computers continued to develop. In the micro computer age the computer
          were mostly used as a very specialized machine. In many cases it was a
          toy used for gaming or a little bit of home programming. Later that
          changed, as the internet developed and people began to connect. In the
          words of Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and the developer of
          MSDOS: “I think it&#39;s fair to say that personal computers have become
          the most empowering tool we&#39;ve ever created. They&#39;re tools of
          communication, they&#39;re tools of creativity, and they can be shaped
          by their user.”
