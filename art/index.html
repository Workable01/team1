        <h1 id="russian-constructivism">Russian constructivism</h1>
        <p>
          In the early 1900s, several revolutionary
          directions in art and design began, for later to develop into modernism,
          which today we know so well from the majority of the design we surround
          ourselves in our everyday lives. But at that time there were thoughts
          that art should not be reserved for the upper class. That art can be
          constructed, abstract, without ornaments, new and provocative – and for
          the people. One might argue that Russia first came up with the new
          modernist ideas. <strong>Russian futurism</strong> served as the basis
          for the new art form. It initially led to Russian constructivism and
          later to <em>&#39;der Stijl&#39;</em> and <em>&#39;Bauhaus&#39;</em> in
          the West. Bauhaus is today considered to be the cradle of modernism.
          Within constructivism this meant that, in essence, the expressive
          personal touch was rejected, looking away from the illustrative and
          hand-made expressions. One sought for pure and universal expression. ie.
          ornaments were removed from the design and they saw the simple geometric
          shapes as an objective reality in itself. It was created by the Russian
          avant-garde but quickly spread to the entire continent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constructivism influenced architecture, poetry, music, and even the
          consumer market and became the new everyday life in Russia of the time.
          In the mid-1930s the end of Russian constructivism began when Stalin
          ordered art to be realistic and not abstract, ie. the opposite of
          constructivism&#39;s foundations and ideas, which were instead replaced
          by socialist realism. <strong class="yes">El Lissitzky (1890 - 1941)</strong> is one
          of the most influential and famous designers from the period. He uses
          primary colours and geometric shapes in the belief that this would be
          the new universal visual language that would be understood by everyone.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &quot;One of our utopian ideas is the desire to overcome the
            limitations of the substructure, of the earthbound. We have developed
            this idea in a series of proposals. [...] The idea of the conquest of
            the substructure, the earthbound, can be extended even further and
            calls for the conquest of gravity as such. It demands floating
            structures, a physical-dynamic architecture.&quot; (El Lissitzky
            (1929) in &#39;Basic Premises&#39; in &#39;Rußland: Die Rekonstruktion
            der Architektur in der Sowjetunion&#39;, Moscow 1929, in
            Interrelationships Between the Art, in An Architecture for World
            Revolution, transl. Eric Dluhosch - MIT Press. Cambridge, MA: 1970)

          Lissitzky saw the square as the source of all creative unfolding. He is
          especially known for his famous propaganda poster:
          <em>&quot;Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge&quot;</em> where a red
          triangle, symbolizing the Communist rebel movements, pierces a white
          circle that would symbolize the Bolsheviks. El Lissitzky - Beat the
          Whites with the Red Wedge, 1919A poster that would encourage the people
          to revolution against the ruling regime. A revolution that came later,
          that today we denote <em>&#39;The Russian Revolution&#39;</em>.
          Lissitzky later travelled to the West, where he moved the constructivist
          ideals into the art group &#39;De Stijl&#39;.

          <strong>Alexander Rodchenko</strong> (1891-1956) is another famous
          artist in Russian constructivism. He started his career painting, then
          he worked with graphic design, and later he worked with the photograph.
          His photographs were socially engaged and innovative. He often shot his
          photos from an unusual angle – high above or below to shock the viewer.
          He wrote:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &quot;One has to take several different shots of a subject, from
            different points of view and in different situations, as if one
            examined it in the round rather than looked through the same key-hole
            again and again.&quot;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In his work on graphic design, he sought the unambiguous universal form.
          His work is characterized by its dynamics and energy.
          <strong>Gustav Klutsis</strong> (1895 – 1938) is claimed to together
          with Hannah Höch, Raoul Hausmann and El Lissitzky to have created the
          subgenre <em>&#39;Political photomontage&#39;</em>. A subgenre that
          originated in 1918. The ongoing theme in his works is
          <strong>propaganda</strong> and <strong>revolution</strong>. His first
          remarkable piece of work was a series of removable kiosks that were
          installed on the streets of Moscow in 1922. The kiosks were equipped
          with radio speakers, screens showing movies, and newspapers. The
          installation should mark the 5th anniversary of the Russian Revolution.

        <h2 id="design-guidelines">Design guidelines</h2>
        <h3 id="typefaces">Typefaces</h3>
        <p>
          The typefaces of Russian constructivism are typically geometric, clean
          and straight forms. ie. within the classification, it will typically be
          a sans serif: no feet, ornaments or swung curves and no contrasts in the
          line, which means that the line has the same thickness throughout the
          letter. Headings can be crooked in an often diagonal expression. One
          sought for a universal and pure expression, where all ornaments were
          removed.
        </p>
        <h3 id="colours">Colours</h3>
        <p>
          Clean colours - and especially the primary colours - were to be
          preferred. In Russian constructivism, we especially see the red colours
          which became a symbol of the people&#39;s revolution. In addition, black
          and white, where the white is not a pure white but a cracked white, due
          to the fact that it did not print the white colour but let the paper
          shine through. The paper was not bleached white as we know it today but
          was more like a cracked white we know today from, for example, natural
          paper. There were often only two colours in a design used together with
          the black and chapped white.
        </p>
        <h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
        <p>
          Strong graphic layout, simple and powerful in their expression. The
          layout can be both static in its structure ie. almost symmetrical or
          have dynamic and diagonal compositions. Sharp and geometric shapes
          characterise the design. Illustrations are not used in Russian
          constructivism, but on the other hand, photographs are used as a collage
          element. Posters often have strong messages. The street artist Shepard
          Fairey and the band Franz Ferdinand are some of the contemporary artists
          who have clear and direct references to Russian Constructivism in their
          visual arts. But the term in today&#39;s context receives a different
          content and message than the highly propagandist and revolutionary
          message it had at that time of its origin.
